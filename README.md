# AI-based PR reviewer and summarizer w/ Amazon Bedrock Claude
This is a modified version of [coderabbitai/ai-pr-reviewer](https://github.com/coderabbitai/ai-pr-reviewer) to use Amazon Bedrock instead.

## Overview

PR SideKick is an AI-based code reviewer and summarizer for GitHub pull requests using Bedrock's Anthropic Claude models. It is designed to be used as a GitHub Action and can be configured to run on every pull request and review comments.

## Reviewer Features:

- **PR Summarization**: It generates a summary and release notes of the changes
  in the pull request.
- **Line-by-line code change suggestions**: Reviews the changes line by line and
  provides code change suggestions.
- **Continuous, incremental reviews**: Reviews are performed on each commit
  within a pull request, rather than a one-time review on the entire pull
  request.
- **Cost-effective and reduced noise**: Incremental reviews save on Bedrock costs
  and reduce noise by tracking changed files between commits and the base of the
  pull request.
- **"Light" model for summary**: Designed to be used with a "light"
  summarization model and a "heavy" review model.
- **Chat with bot**: Supports conversation with the bot in the context of lines
  of code or entire files, useful for providing context, generating test cases,
  and reducing code complexity.
- **Smart review skipping**: By default, skips in-depth review for simple
  changes (e.g. typo fixes) and when changes look good for the most part. It can
  be disabled by setting `review_simple_changes` and `review_comment_lgtm` to
  `true`.
- **Customizable prompts**: Tailor the `system_message`, `summarize`, and
  `summarize_release_notes` prompts to focus on specific aspects of the review
  process or even change the review objective.

To use this tool, you need to add the provided YAML file to your repository and
configure the required IAM role. For more information on usage, examples, contributing, and

## Install instructions

You have to create an IAM role first for authenticating Bedrock API. You can use [the CloudFormation template](docs/oidc-cfn.yaml) to create one. Please replace `SubjectClaimFilters` field value to allow access to your GitHub repository.

`ai-pr-reviewer` runs as a GitHub Action. Add the below file to your repository at `.github/workflows/ai-pr-reviewer.yml`. Please replace `role-to-assume` field value to the actual IAM role ARN created by the CloudFormation template.

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: configure aws credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/YourOidcIamRole
          role-session-name: gha-session
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: PR review
        uses: tmokmss/bedrock-pr-reviewer@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

#### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should already be available to the GitHub Action
  environment. This is used to add comments to the pull request.

### Prompts & Configuration

See: [action.yml](./action.yml)

Tip: You can change the bot personality by configuring the `system_message`
value. For example, to review docs/blog posts, you can use the following prompt:

<details>
<summary>Blog Reviewer Prompt</summary>

```yaml
system_message: |
  You are `/reviewbot` (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model
  trained by Bedrock. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced
  DevRel (developer relations) professional with focus on cloud-native
  infrastructure.

  Company context -
  AI reviewer is an AI-powered Code reviewer.It boosts code quality and cuts manual effort. Offers context-aware, line-by-line feedback, highlights critical changes,
  enables bot interaction, and lets you commit suggestions directly from GitHub.

  When reviewing or generating content focus on key areas such as -
  - Accuracy
  - Relevance
  - Clarity
  - Technical depth
  - Call-to-action
  - SEO optimization
  - Brand consistency
  - Grammar and prose
  - Typos
  - Hyperlink suggestions
  - Graphics or images (suggest Dall-E image prompts if needed)
  - Empathy
  - Engagement
```

</details>

## Conversation with AI reviewer

You can reply to a review comment made by this action and get a response based
on the diff context. Additionally, you can invite the bot to a conversation by
tagging it in the comment (`/reviewbot`).

Example:

> @prsidekick Please generate a test plan for this file.

Note: A review comment is a comment made on a diff or a file in the pull
request.

### Ignoring PRs

Sometimes it is useful to ignore a PR. For example, if you are using this action
to review documentation, you can ignore PRs that only change the documentation.
To ignore a PR, add the following keyword in the PR description:

```text
@prsidekick: ignore
```

## Contribute

### Developing

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy, tested
> with node 17+.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

## FAQs

### Review pull requests from forks

GitHub Actions limits the access of secrets from forked repositories. To enable
this feature, you need to use the `pull_request_target` event instead of
`pull_request` in your workflow file. Note that with `pull_request_target`, you
need extra configuration to ensure checking out the right commit:

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: configure aws credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/YourOidcIamRole
          role-session-name: gha-session
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: PR review
        uses: Spcs-Innovation-Tech-Dev/bedrock-pr-reviewer@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

messages

### Disclaimer

- Your code (files, diff, PR title/description) will be sent to Bedrock's servers
  for processing. Please check with your compliance team before using this on
  your private code repositories.
